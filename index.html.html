    <h2>
        Probably not a writer
    </h2>
    <p text-align="justify">
        The silent thinker is name amoung thousands of writing pages who tries to share their thoughts.<br>
        I started this to share my own thoughts, With time I had realised that how much this is important to share your thoughts with people.<br>
        Its ohk to feel low , But its never be ohk to hide your feelings.<br>
        In todays world <b>mental heath</b> is thi biggest problem which we neglect so easily.<br>
        Below I am mentioning my page link so that you can talk to me whenever needed, Or you can share your writeups.<br>
